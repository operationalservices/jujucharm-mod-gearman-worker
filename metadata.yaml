  Mod-Gearman is a Naemon (formerly Nagios) addon which 
  extends Naemon to run scalable and distributed setups. 
  Worker nodes can be placed all over your network while 
  keeping the simplicity of a central configuration. 
  Mod-Gearman can even help to reduce the load on a 
  single Naemon host, because of its smaller and more 
  efficient way of executing host- and servicechecks.
